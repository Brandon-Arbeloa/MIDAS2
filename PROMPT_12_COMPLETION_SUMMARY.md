## Usage Examples

### Starting the Dashboard
```bash
# Run the comprehensive monitoring dashboard
python -m streamlit run Streamlit_Comprehensive_Monitoring.py
```

### Key Monitoring Views

1. **Overview Tab**: Quick system health summary
2. **Task Queue Tab**: Detailed Celery task monitoring
3. **System Resources Tab**: CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
4. **Event Logs Tab**: Windows Event Log viewer
5. **Manual Controls Tab**: Task triggering interface
6. **Export Data Tab**: Report generation and export

### Using Monitoring Utilities
```python
from monitoring_utils import process_monitor, win_logger, monitor_operation

# Monitor an operation
with monitor_operation("Document Processing"):
    # Your operation code here
    pass

# Log to Windows Event Log
win_logger.log_info("MIDAS: Operation completed successfully")
win_logger.log_error("MIDAS: Critical error occurred")

# Monitor a process
pid = process_monitor.start_process("worker", ["python", "worker.py"])
health = process_monitor.check_process_health("worker")
```

### Tracking Search Performance
```python
from search_performance_tracker import performance_tracker

# Track a search operation
with performance_tracker.track_search("machine learning", "documents") as metric:
    # Perform vector search
    performance_tracker.mark_search_stage('vector_search')
    
    # Set results
    metric.num_results = 25
    metric.total_documents_searched = 1500
    
    # Post-processing
    performance_tracker.mark_search_stage('post_processing')

# Get performance summary
summary = performance_tracker.get_search_performance_summary(hours=24)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Complete Visibility**: All system components monitored in one place
2. **Proactive Management**: Real-time alerts and threshold monitoring
3. **Performance Optimization**: Detailed metrics for bottleneck identification
4. **Windows Native**: Deep integration with Windows services and Event Log
5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Export capabilities for trend analysis
6. **User-Friendly**: Interactive interface with visual feedback
7. **Scalable**: Modular design allows easy extension

## Testing
```bash
# Test monitoring utilities
python monitoring_utils.py

# Test search performance tracking
python search_performance_tracker.py

# Run the dashboard
python -m streamlit run Streamlit_Comprehensive_Monitoring.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Add email/SMS alerts for critical events
